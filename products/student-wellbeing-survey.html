                    <ul>
                        <li>Evaluate students' wellbeing through a set of online surveys to students, teachers and parents.</li>
                        <li>Provide a holistic view of social, emotional, physical and digital wellbeing levels in school.</li>
                        <li>Identify areas of strength and areas for improvement, and signpost possible evidence-based interventions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Ideal for</h3>
                <p>Primary schools and Secondary schools (starting age 8+)</p>
                <h3>Required Resources</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Before the survey</strong> - 2-3 hours from School Admin / Wellbeing Lead to setup the survey and communicate to participants.</li>
                    <li><strong>During the survey</strong> - the survey takes approximately 10 minutes for students, 30 min for teachers and 5 minutes for parents to complete. Participants' access to connected devices is required (smartphones / tablets / laptops / computers).</li>
                    <li><strong>After the survey</strong> - additional staff time is needed to review the reports, prepare and execute intervention plans.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Privacy</h3>
                <p>We collect student aliases, instead of real names, so that school staff can recognize and support every student, while keeping student identities safer.</p>
