        <h1>Our Guiding Principles</h1>
        <p>When we started Schoolmait, we defined five core principles to guide our efforts in delivering a valuable, safe, and ethically driven solutions. Here are the principles and some of the decisions and actions we have taken so far:</p>
    </section>
    <section class="section">
        <div class="grid">
            <div class="card principles-accordion">
                <h2 class="accordion-header" data-idx="0">1. Our evaluation must be relevant, credible and practical</h2>
                <ul class="accordion-panel" style="display:none;">
                    <li>We continuously review new research and update our methodology to ensure it is evidence-based and up to date. We also consult with experts on a regular basis about how to improve and further validate our questionnaires and analysis practices.</li>
                    <li>We understand and value the time of teachers and staff. Therefore, we have set a goal to minimise the time spent on technical tasks, such as gathering and analysing data, so that educators can focus on value-adding activities, such as making decisions and taking action.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="accordion-header" data-idx="1">2. We must employ an ethics-driven approach</h2>
                <ul class="accordion-panel" style="display:none;">
                    <li>Data concerning young people deserves special attention. We are committed to collecting and using data in a responsible, fair and ethical manner and to go beyond GDPR's requirements to ensure the privacy of our users.</li>
                    <li>We take a child-centred approach. While our surveys are not anonymous, as this enables schools to support individual students and ensure meaningful impact, we only collect a minimal amount of personal data as possible. For this reason, we do not gather students' full names or other identifying information, except for a designated alias provided by the school. The link between the alias and the student’s identity is maintained exclusively by the school and we do not have access to that information.</li>
                    <li>We inform students that school staff may view their responses for the purpose of supporting their academic growth.</li>
                    <li>We provide the option for participants to skip any question they do not wish to answer.</li>
                    <li>If we share data with external parties, such as for AI-related operations or research purposes, we will take the necessary steps to anonymise the data prior to sharing it in order to protect the privacy of the participants. Any AI-generated content will be clearly labeled to ensure transparency.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="accordion-header" data-idx="2">3. We are all citizens of the world</h2>
                <ul class="accordion-panel" style="display:none;">
                    <li>We aim to operate in an environmentally responsible way and use resources efficiently.</li>
                    <li>We pledge to dedicate at least 1% of our profits to promote wellbeing in schools in less fortunate countries.</li>
                    <li>As global citizens, we have proudly aligned our business model with 4 of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="accordion-header" data-idx="3">4. We think data protection</h2>
                <ul class="accordion-panel" style="display:none;">
                    <li>We place a high priority on data security and take strong measures to protect information and prevent unauthorised access.</li>
                    <li>We use Amazon AWS for hosting our systems and data. Amazon’s strong track record for providing secure infrastructure services makes it a reliable choice for hosting data.</li>
                    <li>We have implemented SSL encryption to secure communication with our servers.</li>
                    <li>Our data retention policy of 3-4 years allows enough time to access important information while reducing the risk of data breaches.</li>
                    <li>We have established a set of internal policies and procedures, conduct regular risk assessments and provide ongoing training to our team to ensure continuous improvement of our information security posture.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="accordion-header" data-idx="4">5. Wellbeing matters for everyone, including ourselves</h2>
                <ul class="accordion-panel" style="display:none;">
                    <li>We aim to create a diverse environment where everyone can think big, have fun and do good.</li>
                    <li>We embrace "work from anywhere" as a strength.</li>
                    <li>We build only products we believe in and we focus on positive long-term impacts.</li>
                </ul>
