                    <p>On Wednesday 26 February 2025, the Indian Business Chamber of Luxembourg (IBCL) held a conference on "Enhancing Student Wellbeing Through Technology" at the University of Luxembourg (Uni.lu) in Luxembourg-Kirchberg.</p>
                    <p>The conference, organised in conjunction with the Uni.lu and Schoolmait, a Luxembourg startup company that develops tools to measure student wellbeing, brought experts, educators, parents and students together to explore "innovative tools and strategies to enhance social, emotional and physical wellbeing in education".</p>
                    <p>Patrizia Luchetta, ESG leader, opened the event, IBCL’s first of 2025.</p>

                    <p>Yuval Somekh, co-founder of Schoolmait, discussed a case study from India in which collected information from 305 thirteen- to sixteen-year-olds in private schools. The wellbeing of the students was measured by analysing the feedback information, issues of concern were then identified, and interventions subsequently implemented. Students were asked about peer relations, safety, physical and digital wellbeing among other questions. The data collected allowed problems within the school setting to be recognised, goals to be identified and intervention plans to be implemented for both individual and classroom problems within the school setting. Student feedback following intervention indicated that they felt their voices were being heard, while parents reported the positive impact went beyond the school setting. In conclusion, Mr Somekh emphasised the importance of remeasuring students’ wellbeing following intervention.</p>
