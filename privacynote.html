            <h2>A Message for Students</h2>
            <p>Your privacy is of utmost importance to us at Schoolmait.</p>
            <p>You have been directed to this page because you may have been asked by your school to complete a questionnaire about your wellbeing. It is important for us at Schoolmait.com, to ensure that you have a clear understanding of how we use, store and share the information you provide through our wellbeing questionnaire.</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>We would like to assure you that although the questionnaire is not anonymous, we only collect the minimum amount of personal information. For instance, we do not require you to provide your full name but instead ask you to use an alias.</li>
                <li>We only share information that contains your alias with school staff for the purpose of supporting your academic progress. Our employees may access the information you provide, but they are unable to identify you as an individual based on the data you provide.</li>
                <li>We currently DO NOT use artificial intelligence (AI) to generate survey questions or analyze responses. If we make such use in the future, we will provide a clear notice to participants before they begin the survey and clearly label any AI-generated content to ensure full transparency.</li>
                <li>We take strong measures to protect the confidentiality of your information and prevent unauthorised access.</li>
                <li>We may use some of the data you provide for other purposes, such as research, which can benefit other students over time. However, we ensure that any data shared is made anonymous so that it cannot be traced back to you as an individual.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The document below provides more detailed information on the types of data we collect, our use and storage of that data and how we secure it.</p>
