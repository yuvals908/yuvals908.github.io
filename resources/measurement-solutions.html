            <br><h2>Critical Requirements<br>for Wellbeing Measurement Solutions</h2><br>
            <p>The following section lists critical requirements and questions to ask when selecting a wellbeing measurement solution right for your school:</p>
            <br>
            <h4>1. Holistic, Comprehensive Coverage</h4>
            <p>Effective tools examine multiple dimensions of wellbeing: social, emotional, physical, and digital, to provide a holistic comprehensive picture to the decision makers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Does the platform cover all wellbeing domains that are relevant to your school?</li>
            </ul>
            <br><h4>2. Multi-Perspective Assessment</h4>
            <p>Some systems offer capabilities to gather inputs from multiple stakeholders including students, teachers, and/or parents to create a more balanced, less biased view.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Whose voices are captured?</li>
                <li>Can parents and staff contribute their insights?</li>
                <li>How different perspectives are compared in the final reporting?</li>
            </ul>
            <br><h4>3. Evidence-Based Framework</h4>
            <p>Tools should be grounded in current research and connect results to evidence-based interventions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What research underpins the tool?</li>
                <li>Does it address modern challenges like social media, AI use, cyberbullying, loneliness, belonging, or sleep habits?</li>
                <li>Are intervention ideas backed up by research-based evidence?</li>
            </ul>
            <br><h4>4. Ease of Implementation</h4>
            <p>Surveys shouldn’t be complicated. They should be quick, intuitive, and low-burden for both staff and students.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How long does setup take and is rollout support avaiable?</li>
                <li>Is the survey device-friendly?</li>
                <li>How quickly results are available after survey completion?</li>
            </ul>
            <br><h4>5. Actionable Reporting and Analytics</h4>
            <p>Data only matters if it drives action. Reports should be clear, detailed, and actionable for school leaders, counselors, and teachers so they can act effectively.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Are reports easy to interpret?</li>
                <li>Do reports highlight areas for development at individual, class, year group, and whole-school levels?</li>
            </ul>
            <br><h4>6. Individual Reporting</h4>
            <p>Some systems are anonymous, others non-anonymous. While anonymity may encourage honesty, the real value of non-anonymous surveys lies in individual reporting, enabling targeted support and individual progress tracking.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Can reports be generated at the individual level?</li>
            </ul>
            <br><h4>7. Intervention Support</h4>
            <p>Some platforms link wellbeing insights to relevant resources and strategies for timely action.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Does the system provide intervention ideas?</li>
                <li>Is professional support available for intervention planning?</li>
            </ul>
            <br><h4>8. Privacy, Security, and Ethical Safeguards</h4>
            <p>Privacy is not just a checkbox, it is a foundational element that underpins the entire system's efficacy and ethical standing.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What data is collected and how is it stored?</li>
                <li>How is AI used and what data is being shared with the AI?</li>
                <li>What safeguards ensure student privacy?</li>
            </ul>
            <br><h4>9. Age-Appropriateness and Customizability </h4>
            <p>Different schools have different needs, such as age groups, language requirements, or unique challenges. Some tools let schools customize or add questions to better address their specific context.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Are different versions of questionnaire available for different age groups?</li>
                <li>Can questionnaire support the languages used in school?</li>
                <li>Can school specific questions be added to the survey?</li>
            </ul>
            <br><h4>10. Real-Time Monitoring</h4>
            <p>Some tools are designed to provide ongoing or real-time feedback for timely responses to emerging issues.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Does the system provide real-time wellbeing checks and alerts?</li>
            </ul>
            <br><h4>11. Integration Capabilities</h4>
            <p>Some tools integrate into school LMS/SIS to efficiently share data between systems.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Can the tool connect with your LMS/SIS?</li>
            </ul>
            <br><h4>12. Cost-Effectiveness</h4>
            <p>Schools need clarity on total cost and time commitments.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is pricing transparent?</li>
                <li>Are extra features or users charged separately?</li>
                <li>What time commitment is required by school staff?</li>
            </ul>
