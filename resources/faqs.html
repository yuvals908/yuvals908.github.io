      <h2>What is student wellbeing?</h2>
      <p>There are many different ways to define the concept of wellbeing in the professional literature. One that we like, from Oxford International Curriculum, defines wellbeing in terms of 4 domains, as taking care of the body, mind, relationships and finding a meaning or purpose in the world.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Why measure wellbeing in schools?</h2>
      <p>Measuring wellbeing in schools helps educators understand how students are feeling and identify areas for improvement. This information can be used to develop targeted interventions and promote higher levels of wellbeing. Research has found that higher levels of wellbeing are positively correlated with higher academic achievements and other educational outcomes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>How to measure wellbeing in schools?</h2>
      <p>Wellbeing is a subjective and multidimensional concept that encompasses physical, mental, emotional and social aspects. As such, measuring it accurately is a complex challenge. However, there are some ways to gain insights into students' wellbeing, such as through observations, interviews, focus groups and surveys or questionnaires. Each of these methods has its strengths and limitations and choosing the right approach or combining methods can help educators obtain the best results.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>What are the benefits of using surveys to measure student wellbeing?</h2>
      <p>Surveys can provide a quick and efficient way to gather information on student wellbeing, help identify areas for improvement and make informed intervention decisions. They also provide a standardised approach that can be compared across different schools or time periods.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>What are the limitations of using surveys?</h2>
      <p>While surveys can serve an important sensor to student wellbeing state, they do have some limitations that should be taken into account.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Surveys may not capture the full complexity of student wellbeing and may be limited by factors such as participant honesty, individual perceptions or other biases. There may also be external factors that impact wellbeing which may not be fully captured in a brief survey, and further analysis may be needed to gain more comprehensive understanding of the results.</li>
        <li>Additionally, surveys reflect the state of student wellbeing at a specific point in time, while wellbeing is dynamic and can change over time.</li>
        <li>Finally, the potential burden on teachers and staff may make it difficult for schools to implement surveys as an effective wellbeing measurement practice. Schools may face challenges in providing the resources (time and funding) to developing appropriate survey questions, running the surveys and analysing the data effectively.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>What questions are asked in a student wellbeing survey?</h2>
      <p>Student wellbeing survey may include questions about social and emotional wellbeing, such as whether the student feels happy coming to school, whether they have friends to play with during breaks, whether they have someone to turn to when they need support and whether they feel safe at school. In addition, questions about physical wellbeing, such as sleeping habits, diet, exercise and screen time may also be included in the survey. The types of questions asked may vary depending on the age of the students.</p>
      <p>To gain a more holistic view of a student's wellbeing, it may be beneficial to ask parents and teachers similar questions. Their perspectives can provide valuable insights into the student's overall wellbeing and identify any potential areas of concern. By gathering information from multiple sources, educators can gain a better understanding of the student's needs and tailor their support accordingly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>What types of wellbeing interventions are the most effective?</h2>
      <p>There are various possible interventions to consider at student, class, year group or school levels. Research has shown that interventions aimed at improving mental wellbeing, such as programs focused on enhancing belonging and engagement and social-emotional skills, as well as physical activity, tend to be more effective. Additionally, interventions that are delivered by trained class teachers, are tailored to social groups, and last longer than three months have been found to be more impactful (Dix et al., 2020).</p>
      <p>It is important to note that every school community is unique and interventions should be tailored to the specific needs of the students and the school environment. Additionally, it is important to regularly evaluate and adjust interventions based on the needs of students and the effectiveness of the interventions.</p>

      <h2>How does Schoolmait approach the challenge of measuring wellbeing?</h2>
      <p>Schoolmait developed a comprehensive approach to measuring wellbeing that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>provides a holistic and less biased assessment  of student’s wellbeing, using inputs from students, parents and teachers.</li>
        <li>provides a detailed analysis for every individual student.</li>
        <li>prioritises student privacy and data security by using student aliases instead of student names.</li>
        <li>reduces burden on school staff by saving time spent on developing questionnaires, gathering data and preparing analysis reports.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Which wellbeing elements are being measured?</h2>
      <p>Schoolmait measures the following wellbeing elements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Meaning &amp; Purpose:</strong> finding purpose in the world around, staying motivated,  achieving personal goals, and striving to be better citizens.</li>
        <li><strong>Emotion Management:</strong> skills to understand, regulate and express emotions effectively and the ability to shift between emotions.</li>
        <li><strong>Digital Wellbeing:</strong> developing healthy screen time management and promoting positive online behaviour.</li>
        <li><strong>Student-Teacher Relations:</strong> having positive and supportive relationships with teachers.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety &amp; Belonging:</strong> having a secure, supportive school environment where students feel valued and connected.</li>
        <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> having the ability to adapt to challenges with confidence, through problem-solving, self-belief and flexibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Physical Wellbeing:</strong> maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, and good sleep habits.</li>
        <li><strong>Peer Relations:</strong> building healthy and supportive relationships with peers, as well as social and communication skills.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>How the wellbeing score is calculated?</h2>
      <p>Our questionnaires are based on multiple-choice questions using the Likert scale. We provide additional choices in case a participant does not understand the question or prefers not to answer. We then give each question a wellbeing score between -2 and +2.  Our model calculates average wellbeing scores for each student by averaging the question scores for each element and point of view. We can then also calculate average wellbeing scores as well as other statistical metrics for groups of students, such as class, year group, school and even a group of schools.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Is wellbeing measurement considered as a clinical assessment of mental disorders?</h2>
      <p>No, wellbeing measurement is not a clinical assessment. It should be viewed as a tool to support early detection of mild symptoms, so they can be treated before they escalate into more serious conditions. If left unnoticed, these symptoms can develop gradually and eventually become noticeable mental illnesses, resulting in a longer-term and more expensive treatment.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>How schools can use the results of the surveys to promote wellbeing?</h2>
      <p>Schools can use the results of surveys to identify areas where students are struggling and develop targeted interventions. They can also use the results to track progress over time and assess the effectiveness of interventions.</p>
